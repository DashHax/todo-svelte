# ToDo List App using Svelte

Hi. This is a very simple To-do App built using Svelte and Bootstrap.
To run this application, simply follow the following instruction:

1. Clone this repository into a folder
2. `cd` into the cloned folder
3. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
4. Once everything had been installed, run `npm run dev`

You will need Node.js (+ npm) to run the command above.

To build the app, simply run `npm run build`, and the build will be in the `/public` folder. This folder can then be hosted as a static website.
